# Sales Price Detection System

## Overview
The Sales Price Detection System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the sales prices of products based on various features such as product type, brand, seasonality, and historical sales data. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, this system helps businesses and individuals accurately estimate product prices, optimize pricing strategies, and increase profitability.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distributions and relationships between features to uncover insights and trends.
- **Model Training**: Implements various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.
- **Prediction Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input product details and receive sales price predictions.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-price-detection-system.git
cd sales-price-detection-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore data analysis and model training steps. Use the script in the `src/` directory to make predictions:
```bash
python src/predict_price.py --input product_details.json
```
