##Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains several machine learning projects implemented using Python. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, prediction, and classification. Below is an overview of the projects included:

##Projects
1. Car Price Prediction
Predicting car prices based on various features such as mileage, model year, brand, and technical specifications using regression models.

2. Stock Price Analysis
Analyzing historical stock market data to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier or LSTM models.

3. Spam Detection System
Developing a spam detection system to classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.

4. Unemployment Analysis
Analyzing unemployment trends over time using time series forecasting methods and exploring factors influencing unemployment rates.

5. Sales Price Prediction
Predicting sales prices of products based on historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant features using regression techniques.

##Usage
Each project directory contains its own README.md file with specific instructions on how to set up and run the project. Please refer to individual project directories for detailed information.

##Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (specific requirements may vary by project)
