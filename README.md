Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my machine learning repository! This repository contains a collection of projects focusing on data analysis, prediction, and classification using Python and various machine learning techniques.

Projects Overview
1. Car Price Prediction
Objective: Predict car prices based on features like mileage, model year, brand, and technical specifications.
Techniques Used: Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression).
Tools & Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
Directory: car_price_prediction/
2. Stock Price Analysis
Objective: Analyze historical stock market data to predict future stock prices.
Techniques Used: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest Classifier, LSTM models).
Tools & Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib.
Directory: stock_price_analysis/
3. Spam Detection System
Objective: Develop a system to classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP).
Techniques Used: Text preprocessing, feature extraction, classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
Tools & Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas.
Directory: spam_detection_system/
4. Unemployment Analysis
Objective: Analyze trends in unemployment rates over time and explore factors influencing unemployment.
Techniques Used: Time series analysis, forecasting methods.
Tools & Libraries: pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib.
Directory: unemployment_analysis/
5. Sales Price Prediction
Objective: Predict sales prices of products using historical sales data and market trends.
Techniques Used: Regression techniques (e.g., Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting).
Tools & Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
Directory: sales_price_prediction/
