# Machine Learning Project Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project Repository! This repository houses a collection of diverse machine learning projects designed to tackle different real-world problems. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, along with user-friendly interfaces for predictions and insights.

## Projects

### 1. Car Price Prediction System
The Car Price Prediction System predicts the prices of used cars based on features like make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It uses various regression models to provide accurate price estimates, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training with multiple algorithms
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- User-friendly prediction interface

### 2. Spam Detection System
The Spam Detection System classifies emails or messages as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. This helps users filter out unwanted messages and focus on relevant communications.

**Features:**
- Text data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Model training with classification algorithms
- Model evaluation with accuracy and F1-score
- Prediction interface for classifying messages
