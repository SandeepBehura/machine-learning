# Car Price Prediction System

## Overview
The Car Price Prediction System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms, this system helps users estimate the market value of a car, enabling informed decision-making for buyers and sellers.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distributions and relationships between features to uncover insights.
- **Model Training**: Implements various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.
- **Prediction Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input car details and receive price predictions.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore data analysis and model training steps. Use the script in the `src/` directory to make predictions:
```bash
python src/predict_price.py --input car_details.json
```
