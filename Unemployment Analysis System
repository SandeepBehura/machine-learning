# Unemployment Analysis System

## Overview
The Unemployment Analysis System is a data-driven project designed to analyze and visualize unemployment trends over time. Utilizing statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, this system helps uncover patterns, predict future unemployment rates, and provide insights into the factors influencing unemployment.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Aggregates unemployment data from reliable sources, including government databases and economic reports.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes unemployment trends, demographic breakdowns, and regional differences using interactive charts and graphs.
- **Model Training**: Implements time series analysis and machine learning models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Linear Regression, to forecast future unemployment rates.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to identify the most accurate predictors.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard for users to explore data, visualize trends, and make predictions.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-analysis-system.git
cd unemployment-analysis-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore data analysis and model training steps. Use the script in the `src/` directory to perform unemployment predictions:
```bash
python src/predict_unemployment.py --input data/unemployment_data.csv
```
